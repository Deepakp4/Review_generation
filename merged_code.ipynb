While there is not absolute consensus on whether this paper should be accepted, one of the main criticisms of this paper is that sparse compute is not always realistic or efficient on a GPU.  While this may be true of the current SOTA in hardware, emerging computing platforms and CPU libraries may handle sparse networks quite well.  For this reason, I am willing to down-weight this criticism. Based on the remaining comments, this paper has the merit to be accepted, even if it is a bit forward looking in terms of the hardware platforms it targets.\\n\\n\",\n          \"This paper proposes a novel application of generative adversarial networks to model neural spiking activity.  Their technical contribution, SpikeGAN, generates neural spikes that accurately match the statistics of real recorded spiking behavior from a small number of neurons.\\n\\nThe paper is controversial among the reviewers with a 4, a 6 and an 8.  The 6 is short and finds the idea exciting but questions the utility of the proposed approach in terms of actually studying neural spiking.  The 4 and 8 are both quite thorough reviews.  4 seems to mostly question the motivation of using a GAN over a MaxEnt model and demands empirical comparison to other approaches.  8 applauds the paper as a well-executed pure application paper, applying recent innovations in machine learning to an important application with some technical innovation.  Overall the reviewers found the paper clear and easy to follow and agree that the application of GANs to neural spiking activity is novel.  In general, I find that such high variance in scores (with thorough reviews) indicate that the paper is exciting, innovative and might stir up some interesting discussion.  As such, and under the belief that ICLR is made stronger with interesting application papers, I feel inclined to accept as a poster.\\n\\nPros:\\n- A novel application of GANs to neural spiking data\\n- Addresses an important and highly studied application area (computational neuroscience)\\n- Clearly written and well presented\\n- The approach appears to model well real neural spiking activity from salamander retina\\n\\nCons:\\n- Known pitfalls of GANs aren't really addressed in the paper (mode collapse, etc.)\\n- The authors don't compare to state of the art models of neural spiking activity (although they compare to an accepted standard approach - MaxEnt)\\n- Limited technical innovation over existing methods for GANs\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":2}],"source":["df_review=pd.read_json(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/Dissertation_review/merged/merged_review.json\")\n","df_review.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":29,"status":"ok","timestamp":1720553318499,"user":{"displayName":"Deepak Prajapati","userId":"17598353147510010387"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"I1v2w6RO92eu","outputId":"b372fec0-c33a-47d4-e4e6-55de9378e49c"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 8829 entries, 0 to 8828\n","Data columns (total 3 columns):\n"," #   Column      Non-Null Count  Dtype \n","---  ------      --------------  ----- \n"," 0   id          8829 non-null   object\n"," 1   reviews     8829 non-null   object\n"," 2   metaReview  5952 non-null   object\n","dtypes: object(3)\n","memory usage: 207.1+ KB\n"]}],"source":["df_review.info()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":313,"status":"ok","timestamp":1720555401422,"user":{"displayName":"Deepak Prajapati","userId":"17598353147510010387"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"PIAfdH3zF4Yv","outputId":"1471a9c1-a69d-4f59-8e8f-8b43dee42c31"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["0                                                     NaN\n","1                                                     NaN\n","2                                                     NaN\n","3                                                     NaN\n","4                                                     NaN\n","                              ...                        \n","8824    The paper proposes a method for stopping unnec...\n","8825    This paper proposes two algorithms for recover...\n","8826    After discussion and the author response, the ...\n","8827    The paper presents HAAR - a hierarchical reinf...\n","8828    After discussions among the reviewers, they al...\n","Name: metaReview, Length: 8829, dtype: object"]},"execution_count":17,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["df_review['metaReview']"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":53},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":445,"status":"ok","timestamp":1720555971926,"user":{"displayName":"Deepak Prajapati","userId":"17598353147510010387"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"zHL0mXP0IAoO","outputId":"6c715fa3-0145-47d6-a482-f024646e4b02"},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"},"text/plain":["'After discussion and the author response, the reviewers landed on a consensus that the paper would be a good addition to the NeurIPS program.

At line 228, authors mentioned beam search, similar to Viterbi, requires to compute the optimal path of the full sequence. Beam search is a greedy approach and for beam size of k, only looks at the k top recent paths for decoding.

They also use a proof framework to prove the competitive ratio for each method. The proof method first computes the lower bound of ON, so that gets the relationship between the ON and OPT. And then it uses the properties of geometric series to find an upper bound of competitive ratio. The authors also design a dynamic programming method to efficiently compute reward accumulation, and prove its complexity. Finally, they prove the lower bounds of competitive ratio for general deterministic online algorithms. In Section 7, they compare their method, i.e., peek search, with another online inference method OSA on a genome dataset.  I have to admit that I am not familiar with this area, so can only go through a part of the proof, and I am not able to evaluate the originality and quality of this work.  Pros: 1. The paper is well written and easy to follow. The proof is clear and thorough.  2. I think the proof framework should be useful for proving similar problems. 4. The proposed methods have solid theoretical guarantees.  3. I believe that the lower bounds are important, which can give guidance to design new online inference method.  Cons: 1. The paper mentions adversarial rewards a few times, but I did not see further discussion or proof of this topic. 2. It would be better if the authors can provide more details about how to compute the sum of geometric series, and how to set the \\\\gamma in the appendix. 3. In the experiments, the authors only use one dataset, and show the results of peek search. It would be better if the authors can show results on more dataset and results of randomized peek search and peek reset.  =============================== I have read the authors' responses, and other reviewers' comments. I did not change my score. I agree with the other reviewers that the theorems in this paper are interesting. The main reason that I did not change the score is that I am not quite familiar with this area, so I cannot evaluate the significance of this paper.

(2010), Pechenizkiy et al. (2006), Zhu & Wu (2004)). Noisy labels also tend to be more harmful than noisy attributes (Zhu & Wu (2004)). Noisy data are usually related to the data collection process. Typically, the labels used to train a classifier are assumed to be unambiguous and accurate. However, this assumption often does not hold since labels that are provided by human judgments are subjective. Many of the largest image datasets have been extracted from social networks. These images are labeled by non-expert users and building a consistent model based on a precisely labeled training set is very tedious. Mislabeling examples have been reported even in critical applications such as biomedical datasets where the available data are restricted (Alon et al. (1999)). A very common approach to noisy datasets is to remove the suspect samples in a preprocessing stage or have them relabeled by a data expert (Brodley & Friedl (1999)). However, these methods are not scalable and may run the risk of removing crucial examples that can impact small datasets considerably.\\nVariants that are noise robust have been proposed for the most common classifiers such as logisticregression and SVM (Frénay & Verleysen (2014), Jakramate & Kabán (2012), Beigman & Klebanov (2009)). However, classifiers based on label-noise robust algorithms are still affected by label noise. From a theoretical point of view, Bartlett et al. (2006) showed that most loss functions are not completely robust to label noise. Natarajan et al. (2013) proposed a generic unbiased estimator for binary classification with noisy labels. They developed a surrogate cost function that can be expressed by a weighted sum of the original cost functions, and provided asymptotic bounds for performance. Grandvalet & Bengio (2005) addressed the problem of missing labels that can be viewed as an extreme case of noisy label data. They suggested a semi-supervised algorithm that encourages the classifier to predict the non-labeled data with high confidence by adding a regularization term to the cost function. The problem of classification with label noise is an active research area. Comprehensive up-to-date reviews of both the theoretical and applied aspects of classification with label noise can be found in Frénay & Kaban (2014) and Frénay & Verleysen (2014).\\nIn spite of the huge success of deep learning there are not many studies that have explicitly attempted to address the problem of Neural Net (NN) training using data with unreliable labels. Larsen et al. (1998) introduced a single noise parameter that can be calculated by adding a new regularization term and cross validation. Minh & Hinton (2012) proposed a more realistic noise model that depends on the true label. However, they only considered the binary classification case. Sukhbaatar & Fergus (2014) recently proposed adding a constrained linear layer at the top of the softmax layer, and showed that only under some strong assumptions can the linear layer be interpreted as the transition matrix between the true and noisy (observed) labels and the softmax output layer as the true probabilities of the labels. Reed et al. (2014) suggested handling the unreliability of the training data labels by maximizing the likelihood function with an additional classification entropy regularization term.\\nThe correct unknown label can be viewed as a hidden random variable. Hence, it is natural to apply the EM algorithm where in the E-step we estimate the true label and in the M-step we retrain the network. Several variations of this paradigm have been proposed (e.g. Minh & Hinton (2012), Bekker & Goldberger (2016)). However, iterating between EM-steps and neural network training does not scale well. In this study we use latent variable probabilistic modeling but we optimize the likelihood score function within the framework of neural networks. Current noisy label approaches assume either implicitly or explicitly that, given the correct label, the noisy label is independent of the feature vector. This assumption is probably needed to simplify the modeling and derive applicable learning algorithms. However, in many cases this assumption is not realistic since a wrong annotation is more likely to occur in cases where the features are misleading. By contrast, our framework makes it easy to extend the proposed learning algorithm to the case where the noise is dependent on both the correct label and the input features. In the next section we describe a model formulation and review the EM based approach. In Section 3 we described our method which is based on adding another softmax layer to the network and in Section 4 we present our results.'},\n","  {'heading': '2 A PROBABILISTIC FRAMEWORK FOR NOISY LABELS',\n","   'text': 'Assume we want to train a multi-class neural-network soft-classifier p(y = i|x;w) where x is the feature vector, w is the network parameter-set and i is a member of the class-set {1, ..., k}. We further assume that in the training process we cannot directly observe the correct label y. Instead, we only have access to a noisy version of it denoted by z. Here we follow the probabilistic modeling and the EM learning approach described in Bekker & Goldberger (2016). In this approach noise generation is assumed to be independent of the features and is modeled by a parameter θ(i, j) = p(z = j|y = i). The noise distribution is unknown and we want to learn it as part of the training phase. The probability of observing a noisy label z given the feature vector x is:\\np(z = j|x;w, θ) = k∑\\ni=1\\np(z = j|y = i; θ)p(y = i|x;w) (1)\\nwhere k is the number of classes. The model is illustrated in the following diagram:\\nNeural-Network\\nw\\nnoisy channel\\nθ\\nx y z\\nIn the training phase we are given n feature vectors x1, ..., xn with the corresponding noisy labels z1, ..., zn which are viewed as noisy versions of the correct hidden labels y1, ..., yn. The loglikelihood of the model parameters is:\\nL(w, θ) = n∑ t=1 log( k∑ i=1 p(zt|yt = i; θ)p(yt = i|xt;w)) (2)\\nBased on the training data, the goal is to find both the noise distribution θ and the Neural Network parameters w that maximize the likelihood function. Since the random variables y1, ..., yn are hidden, we can apply the EM algorithm to find the maximum-likelihood parameter set. In the E-step of\\neach EM iteration we estimate the hidden true data labels based on the noisy labels and the current parameters:\\ncti = p(yt = i|xt, zt;w0, θ0), i = 1, ..., k, t = 1, ..., n (3)\\nwhere w0 and θ0 are the current parameter estimations. In the M-step we update both the NN and the noisy channel parameters. The updated noise distribution has a closed-form solution.\\nθ(i, j) = ∑ t cti1{zt=j}∑\\nt cti , i, j ∈ {1, ..., k} (4)\\nThe k × k matrix θ can be viewed as a confusion matrix between the soft estimates of the true label {cti|i = 1, ..., k} and the observed noisy labels zt. As part of the EM M-step, to find the updated NN parameter w we need to maximize the following function:\\nS(w) = n∑ t=1 k∑ i=1 cti log p(yt = i|xt;w) (5)\\nwhich is a soft-version of the likelihood function of the fully observed case, based on the current estimate of the true labels. The back-propagation derivatives of the function (5) that we maximize in the M-step are:\\n∂S ∂ui = n∑ t=1 (p(yt = i|xt, zt;w0, θ0)− p(yt = i|xt;w))h(xt) (6)\\nsuch that h is the final hidden layer and u1, ..., uk are the parameters of the soft-max output layer.\\nThe method reviewed here is closely related to the work of Minh & Hinton (2012). They addressed the problem of mislabeled data points in a particular type of dataset (aerial images). The main difference is that in their approach they assumed that they do not learn the noise parameter. Instead they assume that the noise model can be separately tuned using a validation set or set by hand. Note that even if the true noise parameters are given, we still need the apply the EM iterative procedure. However, this assumption makes the interaction between the E-step and the NN learning much easier since each time a data-point xt is visited we can compute the p(yt = i|xt, zt) based on the current network parameters and the pre-defined noise parameters. Motivated by the need for model compression, Hinton et al. (2014) introduced an approach to learn a “distilled” model by training a more compact neural network to reproduce the output of a larger network. Using the notation defined above, in the second training stage they actually optimized the cost function: S(w) =∑n\\nt=1 ∑k i=1 p(yt = i|xt;w0, θ0) log p(yt = i;xt;w) such that w0 is the parameter of the larger network that was trained using the labels z1, ..., zn, w is the parameter of the smaller network and θ0(i, j) in this case is a non-informative distribution (i.e. θ0(i, j) = 1/k).\\nThere are several drawbacks to the EM-based approach described above. The EM algorithm is a greedy optimization procedure that is notoriously known to get stuck in local optima. Another potential issue with combining neural networks and EM direction is scalability. The framework requires training a neural network in each iteration of the EM algorithm. For real-world, large-scale networks, even a single training iteration is a non-trivial challenge. Moreover, in many domains (e.g. object recognition in images) the number of labels is very large, so many EM iterations are likely to be needed for convergence. Another drawback of the probabilistic models is that they are based on the simplistic assumption that the noise error is only based on the true labels but not on the input features. In this study we propose a method for training neural networks with noisy labels that successfully addresses all these problems.'},\n","  {'heading': '3 TRAINING DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS USING A NOISE ADAPTATION LAYER',\n","   'text': 'In the previous section we utilized the EM algorithm to optimize the noisy-label likelihood function (2). In this section we describe an algorithm that optimizes the same function within the framework of neural networks. Assume the neural network classifier we are using is based on non-linear intermediate layers followed by a soft-max output layer used for soft classification. Denote the non-linear\\nfunction applied on an input x by h = h(x) and denote the soft-max layer that predicts the true y label by:\\np(y = i|x;w) = exp(u > i h+ bi)∑k\\nl=1 exp(u > l h+ bl)\\n, i = 1, ..., k (7)\\nwhere w is the network parameter-set (including the softmax layer). We next add another softmax output layer to predict the noisy label z based on both the true label and the input features:\\np(z = j|y = i, x) = exp(u>ijh+ bij)∑ l exp(u > ilh+ bil)\\n(8)\\np(z = j|x) = ∑ i p(z = j|y = i, x)p(y = i|x) (9)\\nWe can also define a simplified version where the noisy label only depends on the true label; i.e. we assume that labels flips are independent of x:\\np(z = j|y = i) = exp(bij)∑ l exp(bil)\\n(10)\\np(z = j|x) = ∑ i p(z = j|y = i)p(y = i|x) (11)\\nWe denote the two noise modeling variants as the complex model (c-model) (8) and the simple model (s-model) (10). Hereafter we use the notation wnoise for all the parameters of the second softmax layer which can be viewed as a noise adaptation layer.\\nIn the training phase we are given n feature vectors x1, ..., xn with corresponding noisy labels z1, ..., zn which are viewed as noisy versions of the correct hidden labels y1, ..., yn. The loglikelihood of the model parameters is:\\nS(w,wnoise) = ∑ t log p(zt|xt) = ∑ t log( ∑ i p(zt|yt = i, xt;wnoise)p(yt = i|xt;w)) (12)\\nSince the noise is modeled by adding another layer to the network, the score S(w,wnoise) can be optimized using standard techniques for neural network training. By setting\\np(z = j|y = i) = θ(i, j) = exp(bij)∑ l exp(bil) , (13)\\nit can easily verified that, by using either the EM algorithm (2) or the s-model neural network scheme (12), we are actually optimizing exactly the same function. Thus the neural network with the s-model noise adaptation layer provides an alternative optimization strategy to the EM algorithm. Instead of alternating between optimizing the noisy model and the network classifier, we consider them as components of the same network and optimize them simultaneously.\\nNote that in the c-model, where the noise is also dependent on the input features, we can still apply the EM algorithm to learn the parameters of the additional noise layer. However, there is no closedform solution in the M-step for the optimal parameters and we need to apply neural-network training in the M-step to find the noise-layer parameters.\\nAt test time we want to predict the true labels. Hence, we remove the last softmax layer that aims to get rid of the noise in the training set. We compute the true-label softmax estimation p(y = i|x;w) (7). The proposed architecture for training the neural network based on training data with noisy labels is illustrated in Figure 1.\\nThere are degrees of freedom in the two softmax layer model. Hence, a careful initialization of the parameters of the noise adaptation layer is crucial for successful convergence of the network into a good classifier of the correct labels at test time. We used the parameters of the original network to initialize the parameters of the s-model network that contains the noise adaptation level. We can initialize the softmax parameters of the s-model by assuming a small uniform noise:\\nbij = log((1− )1{i=j} +\\nk−1 1{i 6=j})\\nsuch that k is the number of different classes. A better procedure is to first train the original NN without the noise-adaptation layer, ignoring the fact that the labels are noisy. We can then treat the labels produced by the NN as the true labels and compute the confusion matrix on the train set and used it as an initial value for the bias parameters:\\nbij = log(\\n∑ t 1{zt=j}p(yt = i|xt)∑\\nt p(yt = i|xt) )\\nsuch that x1, ..., xn are the feature vectors of the training dataset and z1, ..., zn are the corresponding noisy labels. So far we have concentrated on parameter initialization for the s-model. The strategy that works best to initialize the c-model parameters is to use the parameters that were optimized for the s-model. In other words we set linear terms uij to zero and initialize the bias terms bij with the values that were optimized by the s-model.\\nThe computational complexity of the proposed method is quadratic in the size of the class-set. Suppose there are k classes to predict, in this case the proposed methods require k+1 sets of softmax operations with a size of k each. Hence there are scalability problems when the class set is large. As we explained in the previous paragraph, we initialized the second soft-max layer using the confusion matrix of the baseline system. The confusion matrix is a good estimation of the label noise. Assume the rows of the matrix correspond to the true labels and the matrix columns correspond to the noisy labels. The l largest elements in the i-th row are the most frequent noisy class values when the true class value is i. We can thus connect the i-th element in the first softmax layer only to its l most probable noisy class candidates. Note that if we connect the i-th label in the first softmax only to the i-th label in the second softmax layer, the second softmax layer collapses to identity and we obtain the standard baseline model. Taking the l most likely connections to the second softmax layer, we allow an additional l−1 possible noisy labels for each correct label. We thus obtain a data driven sparsifying of the second softmax layer which solves the scalability problem since the complexity becomes linear in the number of classes instead of quadratic. In the experiment section we show that by using this approach there is not much deference in performance.\\nOur architecture, which is based on a concatenation of softmax layers, resembles the hierarchical softmax approach Morin & Bengio (2005) that replaces the flat softmax layer with a hierarchical layer that has the classes as leaves. This allowed them to decompose calculating the probability of the class into a sequence of probability calculations, which saves us from having to calculate the expensive normalization over all classes. The main difference between our approach and theirs (apart from the motivation) is that in our approach the true-label softmax layer is fully connected to the noisy-label layer. Sukhbaatar & Fergus (2014) suggested adding a linear layer to handle noisy labels. Their approach is similar to our s-model. In their approach, however, they proposed a different learning procedure.'},\n","  {'heading': '4 EXPERIMENTS',\n","   'text': 'In this section, we evaluate the robustness of deep learning to training data with noisy labels with and without explicit noise modeling. We first show results on the MNIST data-set with injected label\\nnoise in our experiments. The MNIST is a database of handwritten digits, which consists of 28× 28 images. The dataset has 60k images for training and 10k images for testing. We used a two hidden layer NN comprised of 500 and 300 neurons. The non-linear activation we used was ReLU and we used dropout with parameter 0.5. We trained the network using the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba (2014)) with default parameters, which we found to converge more quickly and effectively than SGD. We used a mini-batch size of 256. These settings were kept fixed for all the experiments described below. In addition to a network that is based on fully connected layers, we also applied a network based on a CNN architecture. The results we obtained in the two architectures were similar. The network we implemented is publicly available 1.\\nWe generated noisy data from clean data by stochastically changing some of the labels. We converted each label with probability p to a different label according to a predefined permutation. We used the same permutation as in Reed et al. (2014). The labels of the test data remained, of course, unperturbed to validate and compare our method to the regular approach.\\nWe compared the proposed noise robust models to other model training strategies. The first network was the baseline approach that ignores the fact that the labels of the training data are unreliable. Denote the observed noisy label by z and the softmax decision by q1, ..., qk. The baseline loglikelihood score (for a single input) is:\\nS = ∑ i 1{z=i} log(qi)\\n1code available at https://github.com/udibr/noisy_labels\\nWe also implemented two variants of the noise robust approach proposed by Reed et al. (2014). They suggested a soft version\\nβS − (1− β)H(q) = β ∑ i 1{z=i} log(qi) + (1− β) ∑ i qi log(qi)\\nand a hard version: βS + (1− β)max\\ni log(qi)\\nIn their experiments they took β = 0.8 for the hard version and β = 0.95 for the soft version, and observed that the hard version provided better results. Finally we implemented the two variants of our approach; namely, the noise modeling based only on the labels (s-model) and the noise modeling that was also based on the features (c-model).\\nFigure 2 depicts the comparative test errors results as a function of the fractions of noise. The results are shown for three different sizes of training data i.e. (20%,50%,100%) of the MNIST training subset. Bootstrapping was used to compute confidence intervals around the mean. For 1000 times, N = 10 samples were randomly drawn with repeats from the N available samples and mean was computed. The confidence interval was taken to be the 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles of this process.\\nThe results show that all the methods that are explicitly aware of the noise in the labels are better than the baseline which is the standard training approach. We revalidated the results reported in Reed et al. (2014) and showed that the hard version of their method performs better than the soft version. In all cases our models performed better than the alternatives. In most cases the c-model was better than the s-model. In the case where the entire dataset was used for training, we can see from the results that there was a phase transition phenomenon. We obtained almost perfect classification results until the noise level was high and there was a sudden strong performance drop. Analyzing why this effect occurred is left for future research.\\nWe next show the results on the CIFAR-100 image dataset Krizhevsky & Hinton (2009) which consists of 32 × 32 color images arranged in 100 classes containing 600 images each. There are 500 training images and 100 testing images per class. We used raw images directly without any preprocessing or augmentation. We generated noisy data from clean data by stochastically changing some of the labels. We converted each one of the 100 labels with probability p to a different label according to a predefined permutation. The labels of the test data remained, of course, unperturbed to validate and compare our method to the regular approach. We used a CNN network with two convolutional layers combined with ReLU activation and max-pooling, followed by two fully connected layers. Figure 3 depicts the comparative test errors results as a function of the fractions of noise for three different sizes of training data i.e. (20%,50%,100%) of the CIFAR-100 training\\nsubset. Bootstrapping was used to compute confidence intervals around the mean in the same way as for the MNIST experiment. The results showed that the proposed method works better than the alternatives. The simple model consistently provided the best results but when the noise level was very high the complex method tended to perform better.\\nWe next report experimental results for the sparse variant of our method that remains efficient even when the class set is large. We demonstrate this on the case of the CIFAR-100 dataset which consists of 100 possible classes. For each class we only took the five most probable classes in the confusion matrix which is used to initialize the model parameter (see Section 3). As can be seen in Figure 4, sparsifying the second softmax layer did not not result in a drop in performance'},\n","  {'heading': '5 CONCLUSION',\n","   'text': 'In this paper we investigated the problem of training neural networks that are robust to label noise. We proposed an algorithm for training neural networks based solely on noisy data where the noise distribution is unknown. We showed that we can reliably learn the noise distribution from the noisy data without using any clean data which, in many cases, are not available. The algorithm can be easily combined with any existing deep learning implementation by simply adding another softmax output layer. Our results encourage collecting more data at a cheaper price, since mistaken data labels can be less harmful to performance. One possible future research direction would be to generalize our learning scheme to cases where both the features and the labels are noisy. We showed results on datasets with small and medium sized class-sets. Future research direction would be to evaluate the performance and efficiency of the proposed method on tasks with large class-sets.'},\n","  {'heading': 'ACKNOWLEDGMENTS',\n","   'text': 'This work is supported by the Intel Collaborative Research Institute for Computational Intelligence (ICRI-CI).'}],\n"," 'references': [{'title': 'Broad patterns of gene expression revealed by clustering analysis of tumor and normal colon tissues probed by oligonucleotide arrays',\n","   'author': ['U.

However, the presence of inaccurate class labels is known to deteriorate the performance of even the best classifiers in a broad range of classification problems. Noisy labels also tend to be more harmful than noisy attributes. When the observed label is noisy, we can view the correct label as a latent random variable and model the noise processes by a communication channel with unknown parameters. Thus we can apply the EM algorithm to find the parameters of both the network and the noise and estimate the correct label. In this study we present a neural-network approach that optimizes the same likelihood function as optimized by the EM algorithm. The noise is explicitly modeled by an additional softmax layer that connects the correct labels to the noisy ones. This scheme is then extended to the case where the noisy labels are dependent on the features in addition to the correct labels. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach outperforms previous methods.',\n"," 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package'}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":12}],"source":["df_content['metadata'].iloc[1]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":24,"status":"ok","timestamp":1720693573580,"user":{"displayName":"Deepak Prajapati","userId":"17598353147510010387"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"EyLiURAuE7EC","outputId":"05012508-f916-4a1f-a3c8-a2d7d953010f"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 8854 entries, 0 to 8853\n","Data columns (total 3 columns):\n"," #   Column    Non-Null Count  Dtype \n","---  ------    --------------  ----- \n"," 0   name      8854 non-null   object\n"," 1   metadata  8854 non-null   object\n"," 2   id        8853 non-null   object\n","dtypes: object(3)\n","memory usage: 207.6+ KB\n"]}],"source":["df_content.info()"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# merging df_paper_review with df_content on ID\n","df_paper_review_content=df_paper_review.merge(df_content,on='id')\n","df_paper_review_content.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":486},"id":"JRuSDwYklsoY","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1720693573897,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":329,"user":{"displayName":"Deepak Prajapati","userId":"17598353147510010387"}},"outputId":"44a4af49-dff7-4c49-aa02-5723c77f96a7"},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["              id conference                  decision  \\\n","0  ICLR_2017_381       ICLR                    Reject   \n","1  ICLR_2017_211       ICLR  Invite to Workshop Track   \n","2  ICLR_2017_200       ICLR  Invite to Workshop Track   \n","3  ICLR_2017_106       ICLR           Accept (Poster)   \n","4   ICLR_2017_64       ICLR           Accept (Poster)   \n","\n","                                                 url hasContent hasReview  \\\n","0  http://openreview.net/pdf/63b92f7ce8708e9df35d...       true      true   \n","1  http://openreview.net/pdf/5c54afd2ea867c72b8ae...       true      true   \n","2  http://openreview.net/pdf/e2d348d16ad96d19425e...       true      true   \n","3  http://openreview.net/pdf/5ab63afda67c68cd39a6...       true      true   \n","4  http://openreview.net/pdf/2cb01001f2f89ca11252...       true      true   \n","\n","                                               title  \\\n","0  Multi-task learning with deep model based rein...   \n","1  Nonparametrically Learning Activation Function...   \n","2  Discovering objects and their relations from e...   \n","3  Attend, Adapt and Transfer: Attentive Deep Arc...   \n","4  Training Compressed Fully-Connected Networks w...   \n","\n","                                             authors  \\\n","0                                     [Asier Mujika]   \n","1           [Carson Eisenach, Zhaoran Wang, Han Liu]   \n","2  [David Raposo, Adam Santoro, David Barrett, Ra...   \n","3  [Janarthanan Rajendran, Aravind Lakshminarayan...   \n","4  [Shengjie Wang, Haoran Cai, Jeff Bilmes, Willi...   \n","\n","                                             reviews metaReview  \\\n","0  [{'review': 'The term strategy is a bit ambigu...
